# What's New

## [1.6.0]

### Restore and backup workflow
- Added per-project restore mode (`Direct`, `Sandbox`) with a restore-time override.
- Added sandbox completion actions (`Keep`, `Open sandbox`, `Apply to project`) and apply preflight summary/confirmation.
- Added plain-backup restore preview and selective top-level restore targets.
- Added restore-point timeline compare (`A`/`B`) with range/size/net-diff summary.

### Projects and presets
- Added project tags persistence, pill editing, reusable tag suggestions, and smart groups (`Work`, `Games`, `Media`, `Critical`, `Archive`).
- Added group actions in Projects (snapshot, backup, auto-backup toggles, apply/remove by tag).
- Added preset recommendation engine for common stacks and improved confidence gating.
- Added in-app preset rules editor with reload/test/save plus clone/import/export actions.

### Reliability, diagnostics, and storage insights
- Added support bundle export (`Settings > Advanced`) with redacted config, diagnostics, and telemetry summaries.
- Added per-destination retry policy settings and destination-scoped retry execution with backoff/telemetry.
- Added per-project verification policy (`always`, `scheduled`, `manual`).
- Added backup storage deltas and top-storage-consumer insights in Backups/Dashboard.

### Fixes and hardening
- Fixed major windowed-mode layout/overflow issues across Backups, Projects, Dashboard, and Settings.
- Fixed backup path-containment validation across delete/retention/restore/open-folder flows.
- Hardened elevated patch validation (request path checks + payload/archive integrity checks).
- Fixed project tag input command startup binding noise in diagnostics logs.

### Updates
- Release notes are available in the app. [Release notes](https://github.com/ATAC-Helicopter/VaultSync/releases)
